# Yield Optimization Implementation Plan

**Goal**: Achieve and exceed Block's 9.7% annual yield on Lightning routing
**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: Planning

---

## Analysis: How Block Achieves 9.7%

### Block's Advantage: Captive Flow

Block (Cash App) earns 9.7% on 184 BTC because they have **captive flow**:

```
Cash App User → [Block's Node] → Lightning Network → Destination
```

Every Cash App Lightning payment MUST traverse Block's node. This creates:
- **Zero competition** for that specific flow
- **Price insensitivity** - users don't see/compare fees
- **Guaranteed volume** - millions of users, daily transactions
- **Fee maximization** - they charge up to 2,147,483,647 ppm (yes, that's 214,748%)

### Why Extreme Fees Work for Block

| Factor | Block | Typical Node |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Flow source | Captive (Cash App) | Competitive (network) |
| User fee visibility | Hidden | Visible |
| Competition | None | Intense |
| Volume guarantee | High | Variable |
| Fee elasticity | Inelastic | Highly elastic |

### The Hive's Reality

We don't have captive flow. Our options:

1. **Create captive flow** (LSP services, integrations)
2. **Position on critical paths** (be unavoidable for certain routes)
3. **Reduce costs** (lower rebalancing = higher net yield)
4. **Coordinate fleet** (avoid competing with ourselves)
5. **Exploit information advantage** (see more, act faster)

## Current cl-hive Capabilities Assessment

### What We Have (Strong Foundation)

| Module | Capability | Yield Relevance |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| `fee_intelligence.py` | Fee sharing between members | Coordinate pricing |
| `liquidity_coordinator.py` | Bottleneck detection, rebalance coordination | Reduce costs |
| `routing_intelligence.py` | Route probe aggregation | Information advantage |
| `health_aggregator.py` | NNLB health tiers | Prioritize struggling members |
| `splice_coordinator.py` | Splice safety checks | Capital efficiency |
| `planner.py` | Topology optimization | Strategic positioning |
| `peer_reputation.py` | Reputation tracking | Avoid bad peers |

### What's Missing (Gaps to Fill)

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| No flow velocity tracking | Can't predict demand | HIGH |
| No coordinated fee strategy | Internal competition | HIGH |
| No LSP capability | No captive flow | HIGH |
| No capital efficiency metrics | Unknown ROI per channel | MEDIUM |
| No route monopoly detection | Miss positioning opportunities | MEDIUM |
| No adaptive fee decay | Suboptimal hill climbing | MEDIUM |

## Yield Math: What's Achievable

### Conservative Scenario (Match Block: 10%)

```
Fleet capacity: 10 BTC (1,000,000,000 sats)
Target yield: 10% annually
Required revenue: 100,000,000 sats/year
             = 8,333,333 sats/month
             = 273,973 sats/day

At 500 ppm average fee:
  Required daily volume: 273,973 / 0.0005 = 547,946,000 sats
                       = 5.48 BTC/day routed

At 50% capacity utilization (5 BTC available for routing):
  Required turns: 5.48 / 5 = 1.1 turns/day
```

**Verdict**: Achievable with good positioning and moderate fees.

### Aggressive Scenario (Exceed Block: 15%+)

Three paths to exceed 10%:

1. **Higher fees via positioning**
   - Be on routes with less competition
   - Target specific flow corridors (exchanges ↔ merchants)

2. **Lower costs via coordination**
   - Reduce rebalancing costs by 50% through fleet coordination
   - Pre-position liquidity before demand spikes

3. **Create captive flow via LSP**
   - Offer LSP services to wallets/businesses
   - JIT channel opens capture 100% of flow

### LQWD's 24% - How They Claim It

LQWD reports 24% annualized. Likely includes:
- JIT channel fees (LSPS2)
- On-chain fee savings passed to customers
- Higher risk tolerance (larger channels to fewer peers)
- Possibly accounting for unrealized gains

**Key insight**: LSP services dramatically increase yield potential.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: Measure current state, establish baselines

#### 1.1 Capital Efficiency Metrics

Add tracking for ROI per channel:

```python
@dataclass
class ChannelYieldMetrics:
    channel_id: str
    peer_id: str
    capacity_sats: int

    # Revenue
    routing_revenue_sats: int
    period_days: int

    # Costs
    open_cost_sats: int
    rebalance_cost_sats: int
    opportunity_cost_sats: int  # What we'd earn elsewhere

    # Computed
    net_yield_annual_pct: float
    capital_efficiency: float  # revenue / capacity
    turn_rate: float  # volume / capacity
```

**Implementation**: Extend `revenue_profitability` in cl-revenue-ops bridge.

#### 1.2 Flow Velocity Tracking (already partially exists)

Enhance `advisor_get_velocities` to predict future states:

```python
def predict_channel_state(self, channel_id: str, hours: int = 24) -> Dict:
    """
    Predict channel balance at future time.

    Returns:
        predicted_local_pct: Expected local balance percentage
        depletion_risk: Probability of hitting 0% local
        saturation_risk: Probability of hitting 100% local
        recommended_action: "none" | "preemptive_rebalance" | "raise_fees"
    """
```

**Implementation**: Add to `advisor_db.py`, expose via MCP.

#### 1.3 Internal Competition Detection

Detect when fleet members compete for same flow:

```python
def detect_internal_competition(self) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Find routes where multiple hive members are competing.

    Returns list of:
        source: Origin peer
        destination: Destination peer
        competing_members: List of members with channels to both
        recommendation: "coordinate_fees" | "specialize"
    """
```

**Implementation**: Add to `liquidity_coordinator.py`.

---

### Phase 2: Fee Coordination (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal**: Eliminate internal competition, optimize collective pricing

#### 2.1 Route Ownership Model

Designate "primary" member for each flow corridor:

```python
class FlowCorridorAssignment:
    """
    Assign flow corridors to specific members to avoid competition.

    Algorithm:
    1. Identify all (source, destination) pairs fleet serves
    2. For each pair, assign to member with best:
       - Position (shortest path)
       - Capacity (more liquidity)
       - Historical performance (higher success rate)
    3. Non-primary members set higher fees (fallback only)
    """
```

**Fee Strategy**:
- Primary member: Competitive fee (target volume)
- Secondary members: Premium fee (capture overflow)
- Result: No undercutting, maximized collective revenue

#### 2.2 Adaptive Fee Decay (Pheromone Evaporation)

Replace fixed hill-climbing with adaptive rates:

```python
class AdaptiveFeeController:
    def calculate_adjustment_rate(self, channel_id: str) -> float:
        """
        Faster adjustment during volatility, slower during stability.

        Factors:
        - Balance velocity (fast change = fast adapt)
        - Network fee volatility (market moving = fast adapt)
        - Recent success rate (failures = fast adapt)
        """
        velocity = self.get_balance_velocity(channel_id)
        fee_volatility = self.get_network_fee_volatility()
        success_rate = self.get_recent_success_rate(channel_id)

        # Base rate
        base_rate = 0.1  # 10% adjustment per cycle

        # Velocity multiplier (1x to 3x)
        velocity_mult = 1 + min(2, abs(velocity) / 0.1)

        # Volatility multiplier (1x to 2x)
        volatility_mult = 1 + min(1, fee_volatility / 100)

        # Success penalty (low success = faster adjustment)
        success_mult = 1 + (1 - success_rate)

        return base_rate * velocity_mult * volatility_mult * success_mult
```

#### 2.3 Fleet-Wide Fee Floor

Establish minimum fees to prevent race-to-bottom:

```python
# In fee_intelligence.py
FLEET_FEE_FLOOR_PPM = 100  # Never go below this
FLEET_FEE_CEILING_PPM = 2500  # Don't price out flow

def calculate_coordinated_fee(
    self,
    channel_id: str,
    is_primary: bool,
    market_fee_ppm: int
) -> int:
    """
    Calculate fee that respects fleet coordination.
    """
    if is_primary:
        # Primary: competitive but above floor
        return max(FLEET_FEE_FLOOR_PPM, market_fee_ppm)
    else:
        # Secondary: premium for overflow
        return max(FLEET_FEE_FLOOR_PPM * 2, int(market_fee_ppm * 1.5))
```

---

### Phase 3: Cost Reduction (Weeks 9-12)

**Goal**: Reduce rebalancing costs by 50%

#### 3.1 Predictive Rebalancing

Move liquidity BEFORE it's needed:

```python
class PredictiveRebalancer:
    """
    Rebalance based on predictions, not current state.

    Benefits:
    - Lower urgency = lower fees paid
    - Better timing = more route options
    - Proactive = never desperate
    """

    def should_preemptive_rebalance(self, channel_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
        # Get prediction
        pred = self.predict_channel_state(channel_id, hours=12)

        if pred['depletion_risk'] > 0.7:
            return {
                'action': 'rebalance_in',
                'reason': 'predicted_depletion',
                'urgency': 'low',  # We have time
                'max_fee_ppm': 500  # Can be picky
            }
        elif pred['saturation_risk'] > 0.7:
            return {
                'action': 'rebalance_out',
                'reason': 'predicted_saturation',
                'urgency': 'low',
                'max_fee_ppm': 500
            }
        return None
```

#### 3.2 Fleet Rebalance Routing

Use fleet members as rebalance hops when cheaper:

```python
def find_fleet_rebalance_path(
    self,
    from_channel: str,
    to_channel: str,
    amount_sats: int
) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """
    Find rebalance path through other fleet members.

    Often cheaper because:
    - Fleet members have coordinated fees
    - Can use internal "friendship" rates
    - Better liquidity information
    """
    # Check if path exists through fleet
    fleet_path = self._find_internal_path(from_channel, to_channel)

    if fleet_path:
        fleet_cost = self._estimate_fleet_path_cost(fleet_path, amount_sats)
        external_cost = self._estimate_external_path_cost(from_channel, to_channel, amount_sats)

        if fleet_cost < external_cost * 0.8:  # 20% savings threshold
            return {
                'path': fleet_path,
                'estimated_cost': fleet_cost,
                'savings_pct': (external_cost - fleet_cost) / external_cost
            }
    return None
```

#### 3.3 Circular Rebalance Detection

Identify and prevent wasteful circular flows:

```python
def detect_circular_flows(self) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Detect when fleet pays fees to move liquidity in circles.

    Example: A→B→C→A where A, B, C are all fleet members
    This is pure cost with no benefit.
    """
    # Analyze recent rebalances across fleet
    # Flag any that form cycles
    # Recommend stopping one leg
```

---

### Phase 4: Captive Flow (Weeks 13-20)

**Goal**: Create guaranteed flow sources via LSP services

#### 4.1 Fleet LSP Architecture

```

#### 4.2 LSPS Implementation

Implement LSPS1 (channel ordering) and LSPS2 (JIT channels):

```python
# New module: modules/lsp_service.py

class HiveLSPService:
    """
    Lightning Service Provider backed by the fleet.

    Implements:
    - LSPS1: Channel ordering
    - LSPS2: JIT channel opening

    - Automatic failover
    """

    def handle_channel_request(self, request: Dict) -> Dict:
        """
        Handle LSPS1 channel request.

        1. Select best fleet member to fulfill

    def handle_jit_invoice(self, invoice: Dict) -> Dict:
        """
        Handle LSPS2 JIT channel request.

        1. Generate wrapped invoice
        2. When paid, open channel just-in-time
        3. Deduct channel fee from payment
        """
```

#### 4.3 LSP Fee Structure

```python
# LSP fees (in addition to routing fees)
LSP_CHANNEL_OPEN_FEE_PCT = 1.0    # 1% of channel size
LSP_JIT_CHANNEL_FEE_PCT = 2.0     # 2% of first payment
LSP_INBOUND_LIQUIDITY_FEE_PPM = 1000  # 0.1% for inbound

# Example economics:
# Customer requests 1M sat inbound liquidity
# - Channel open fee: 10,000 sats
# - Monthly liquidity rental: 1,000 sats
# - All routing through us: fees captured
#
# Annual yield on 1M sat channel:
# - Open fee: 10,000 (1%)
# - Liquidity rental: 12,000 (1.2%)
# - Routing fees: ~10,000 (1% at 500ppm, 2 turns/day)
# Total: ~32,000 sats = 3.2% per channel
# But: 100% of customer's flow goes through us
```

---

### Phase 5: Strategic Positioning (Weeks 21-26)

**Goal**: Position fleet on critical network paths

#### 5.1 Identify High-Value Routes

```python
class RouteValueAnalyzer:
    """
    Identify routes with high volume and limited competition.
    """

    def find_valuable_corridors(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """
        Returns corridors ranked by:

        """
        Find "bridge" nodes that connect network clusters.
        Being on the bridge = mandatory routing.

```

#### 5.2 Coordinated Positioning

```python
class FleetPositioningStrategy:
    """
    Coordinate channel opens to maximize fleet coverage.

    Principles:
    1. Don't duplicate - one member per target
    2. Complementary positions - cover different regions

        - Target value
        """
```

#### 5.3 Exchange Connectivity

Exchanges are high-value endpoints. Strategy:

```python
PRIORITY_EXCHANGES = [
    # Known high-volume Lightning exchanges
    "ACINQ",           # Phoenix wallet backend
    "Kraken",          # Major exchange
    "Bitfinex",        # Major exchange
    "River Financial", # Bitcoin-focused
    "Cash App",        # Block (they'll route TO us)
    "Strike",          # High volume
]

def prioritize_exchange_channels(self):
    """
    Fleet should have channels to all major exchanges.

## Projected Yield by Phase

| Phase | Timeline | Expected Yield | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------|
| Baseline (current) | Now | 2-4% | 2-4% |
| Phase 1: Metrics | Week 4 | +1% (awareness) | 3-5% |
| Phase 2: Fee Coordination | Week 8 | +2% (no competition) | 5-7% |

   ```
   ICI = Revenue Lost to Undercutting / Total Revenue
   ```

3. **Rebalancing Efficiency** (target: >3x)
   ```
   RE = Fees Earned from Rebalanced Liquidity / Rebalancing Cost
   ```

4. **Captive Flow Ratio** (target: >30%)
   ```
   CFR = LSP Customer Volume / Total Routed Volume
   ```

### Secondary KPIs

5. **Prediction Accuracy** (target: >80%)
   ```
   PA = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
   ```

6. **Position Value** (target: increasing)

## Swarm Intelligence Integration

The following biological concepts from the research report map directly to yield optimization:

### Concept 1: Adaptive Pheromone Evaporation → Fee Learning

**Biological Basis**: Ant colonies use variable pheromone decay rates—faster in dynamic environments, slower in stable ones. IEACO research shows fixed rates get stuck in local optima.

**Application to Phase 2.2 (Adaptive Fee Decay)**:

```python
class PheromoneBasedFeeController:
    """
    Fee adjustment inspired by ant colony pheromone dynamics.

    Pheromone = "memory" of what worked
    Evaporation = forgetting rate
    Deposit = reinforcement from success

        Dynamic environment (high velocity, fee changes):
          - High evaporation (0.5-0.9)
          - Explore new fee points quickly
        """
        velocity = abs(self.get_balance_velocity(channel_id))
        network_volatility = self.get_fee_volatility()

        # Base evaporation
        base = 0.2

        # Velocity factor: faster drain = faster adaptation
        velocity_factor = min(0.4, velocity * 4)  # Cap at 0.4 addition

        # Volatility factor: market moving = faster adaptation
        volatility_factor = min(0.3, network_volatility / 200)

        return min(0.9, base + velocity_factor + volatility_factor)

    def update_fee_pheromone(
        self,

            else:
                return current_fee
```

**Yield Impact**: Faster convergence to optimal fees, escape local optima, +0.5-1% yield improvement.

---

### Concept 2: Stigmergy → Indirect Fee Coordination

**Biological Basis**: Ants coordinate without direct communication by leaving pheromone trails in the environment. Other ants read these trails and adjust behavior.

**Application to Phase 2.1 (Route Ownership)**:

Instead of explicit "ownership assignment," use stigmergic markers:

### Concept 3: Physarum Flow Optimization → Channel Lifecycle

**Biological Basis**: Slime mold strengthens tubes with high flow and lets low-flow tubes atrophy. This naturally optimizes the network without central planning.

### Concept 5: Robustness + Responsiveness → Noise Filtering

```

**Yield Impact**: Reduces thrashing from reacting to noise. More stable fees = better routing reputation. +0.3-0.5% yield.

### Summary: Swarm Integration Points

| Concept | Phase | Implementation | Yield Impact |
|---------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Pheromone Evaporation | 2.2 | Adaptive fee learning rate | +0.5-1% |
| Stigmergy | 2.1 | Indirect route ownership via markers | +1-2% |
| Physarum Flow | 3 & 5 | Flow-based channel lifecycle | +1-2% |
| Mycelium Warnings | 2 | Collective defense system | +0.5-1% |
| Robustness/Responsiveness | 1 & 2 | Salience filtering | +0.3-0.5% |

**Total additional yield from swarm integration: +3.3-6.5%**

This potentially pushes the achievable yield from 10-12% to **13-18%**.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Implement Phase 1.1**: Add `ChannelYieldMetrics` to revenue tracking
2. **Implement Phase 1.2**: Enhance velocity prediction
3. **Design Phase 2.1**: Route ownership model specification
4. **Implement Phase 2.2**: Adaptive fee decay (pheromone evaporation)
5. **Plan Phase 5**: Exchange connectivity strategy
6. **Prototype**: Pheromone-based fee controller (highest immediate impact)
7. **Prototype**: Salience detector for noise filtering

## Routing Pool: Collective Profit Sharing

### The Concept

A "routing pool" treats the hive as a collective enterprise where:
- Members contribute capital (channels)
- Fleet earns routing fees collectively
- Profits distributed proportional to contribution

This mirrors **mining pools** but for routing:

| Mining Pool | Routing Pool |
|-------------|--------------|
| Contribute hashrate | Contribute liquidity |
| Pool finds blocks | Fleet routes payments |
| Reward ∝ hashrate | Reward ∝ capital deployed |
| Reduces variance | Reduces variance |

### Why This Makes Sense

**1. Aligns with Swarm Intelligence**

Mycelium networks don't track "which fungal thread earned this nutrient." Resources flow to where needed, and the whole network benefits. A routing pool embodies this principle.

**2. Eliminates Internal Competition Completely**

If we share profits, there's zero incentive to undercut fleet members. Your peer's successful route IS your success. This is the ultimate solution to Phase 2's coordination problem.

**3. Enables True Capital Efficiency**

Capital can flow to best positions without individual node operators worrying "but that channel isn't mine." The fleet optimizes collectively.

**4. Reduces Variance**

Individual nodes have high variance—some days great, some days nothing. Pooling smooths returns, making yield more predictable (attractive for serious capital).

**5. Attracts External Capital**

Investors could contribute capital to the pool without running nodes. Fleet operators provide expertise, capital providers provide liquidity. Everyone earns proportionally.

### Contribution Metrics

What constitutes "contribution" to the pool?

```python
@dataclass
class MemberContribution:
    """Track what each member contributes to the pool."""

    member_id: str

    # Capital contribution (primary factor)
    total_capacity_sats: int          # Sum of all channel capacities
    weighted_capacity_sats: int       # Capacity × position_quality
    avg_uptime_pct: float             # Availability matters

    # Position contribution (secondary factor)
    betweenness_centrality: float     # How critical is their position?
    unique_peers: int                 # Peers only they connect to
    bridge_score: float               # Do they connect clusters?

    # Operational contribution (tertiary factor)
    routing_success_rate: float       # Reliable forwarding?
    avg_response_time_ms: float       # Fast forwarding?

    def calculate_pool_share(self) -> float:
        """
        Calculate member's share of pool profits.

        Primary: 70% based on capital
        Secondary: 20% based on position
        Tertiary: 10% based on operations
        """
        capital_score = self.weighted_capacity_sats / POOL_TOTAL_CAPACITY
        position_score = (self.betweenness_centrality * 0.5 +
                         self.bridge_score * 0.5)
        ops_score = (self.routing_success_rate * 0.7 +
                    (1 - self.avg_response_time_ms/1000) * 0.3)

        return (capital_score * 0.70 +
                position_score * 0.20 +
                ops_score * 0.10)
```

### Revenue Attribution

How do we know who "earned" a payment that hopped through multiple fleet nodes?

**Option A: First-Touch Attribution**
- Credit goes to the fleet node that received the payment from outside
- Simple, but ignores contribution of intermediate hops

**Option B: Pro-Rata by Hop**
- Split credit among all fleet nodes in the path
- Fairer, but complex accounting

**Option C: Pool Everything (Recommended)**
- Don't attribute individual payments at all
- All fleet revenue goes to pool
- Distribute based on contribution metrics (above)
- Simplest, most aligned with swarm philosophy

```python
class RoutingPool:
    """
    Collective profit sharing for the hive.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.settlement_period_days = 7  # Weekly settlement
        self.revenue_buffer = 0          # Accumulated fees

    def record_routing_revenue(self, member_id: str, amount_sats: int):
        """
        Record revenue earned by any member.
        Goes to pool, not individual.
        """
        self.revenue_buffer += amount_sats
        self.log_revenue(member_id, amount_sats)  # For transparency

    def calculate_distributions(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
        """
        Calculate how to distribute pool to members.
        """
        contributions = self.get_all_contributions()
        total_shares = sum(c.calculate_pool_share() for c in contributions)

        distributions = {}
        for contrib in contributions:
            share = contrib.calculate_pool_share() / total_shares
            distributions[contrib.member_id] = int(self.revenue_buffer * share)

        return distributions

    def settle(self):
        """
        Distribute accumulated revenue to members.

        In practice: could be actual payments, or just accounting
        entries if members trust each other.
        """
        distributions = self.calculate_distributions()

        for member_id, amount in distributions.items():
            self.record_distribution(member_id, amount)

        self.revenue_buffer = 0
```

### Implementation Considerations

**Trust Model**

| Model | Description | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-------------|------|------|
| **Honor System** | Members report earnings, trust distribution | Simple | Requires trust |
| **Transparent Ledger** | All earnings visible to all members | Verifiable | Privacy concerns |
| **Smart Contract** | On-chain distribution logic | Trustless | Complexity, fees |
| **Custodial Pool** | Central party holds/distributes | Simple UX | Counterparty risk |

**Recommended**: Start with **Transparent Ledger** among trusted members. Each node reports earnings to shared database (already have `advisor_db`). Distribution calculated openly. Actual settlement can be informal initially.

**Minimum Viable Pool**

```python
# Add to advisor_db.py

def record_pool_contribution(self, member_id: str, period: str):
    """Record member's contribution metrics for a period."""
    self.db.execute("""
        INSERT INTO pool_contributions
        (member_id, period, capacity_sats, uptime_pct,
         centrality, success_rate, recorded_at)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
    """, ...)

def record_pool_revenue(self, member_id: str, amount_sats: int):
    """Record revenue earned (goes to pool)."""
    self.db.execute("""
        INSERT INTO pool_revenue
        (member_id, amount_sats, recorded_at)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    """, ...)

def calculate_pool_distribution(self, period: str) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Calculate fair distribution for a period."""
    # ... implementation per above logic
```

### Regulatory Considerations

A routing pool could be viewed as:
- **Investment contract** (members invest capital, expect returns)
- **Partnership** (joint enterprise for profit)
- **Cooperative** (member-owned, democratic)

**Mitigation**:
- Keep membership small and trust-based initially
- No external "investors" - only active node operators
- Frame as operational coordination, not investment scheme
- Consider legal structure if scaling (LLC, cooperative)

### Alignment with Swarm Intelligence

The routing pool is the **economic manifestation** of swarm principles:

| Swarm Principle | Pool Implementation |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Stigmergy | Revenue traces show what works; pool follows |
| Mycelium sharing | Resources flow to where needed, returns shared |
| Collective intelligence | Fleet optimizes as unit, not individuals |
| Robustness | No single point of failure in economics |

This is arguably the most "hive-like" structure possible.

## Conclusion: Can We Match Block's 9.7%?

**Yes, through operational excellence.**

Block has captive flow we can't replicate directly. But we can match their yield through:

1. **Eliminate waste** from internal competition (Phase 2)
2. **Reduce costs** through prediction and coordination (Phase 3)
3. **Position strategically** on high-value routes (Phase 5)
4. **Pool profits** to align incentives completely (Routing Pool)

The fleet's structural advantages—information sharing, coordinated pricing, collective positioning, shared economics—enable yields that individual nodes cannot achieve.

**Target**: 10-15% annual yield within 4 months of implementation.

This matches or exceeds Block's 9.7% through coordination rather than market captivity. The components compound:
- Fee coordination prevents undercutting (+2%)
- Cost reduction improves margins (+2%)
- Strategic positioning captures premium routes (+3%)
- Swarm intelligence optimizations (+3-6%)
- Routing pool alignment (enables all of the above)

LSP services remain a future option to push beyond 15%.
