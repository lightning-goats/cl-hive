Planner Module for cl-hive (Phase 6: Topology Optimization)

Implements the "Gardner" algorithm for automated topology management:
- Saturation Analysis: Calculate Hive market share per target
- Guard Mechanism: Prevent redundant channel opens to saturated targets
- Expansion Proposals: Cooperative expansion with feerate gate

CLBoss Integration (Optional):
CLBoss is NOT required. If installed (ksedgwic/clboss fork):
- Uses clboss-unmanage with 'open' tag to prevent CLBoss channel opens to saturated targets
- Uses clboss-manage to re-enable opens when saturation drops
- Fee/balance tags are managed by cl-revenue-ops (not this module)

If CLBoss is NOT installed:
- Saturation detection still runs for analytics
- Hive uses native cooperative expansion instead

Security Constraints (Red Team - PHASE6_THREAT_MODEL):
- Gossip capacity is CLAMPED to public listchannels data
- Max 5 new unmanages per cycle (abort if exceeded)
- All decisions logged to hive_planner_log table

This ticket (6-01) implements ONLY saturation detection and guard mechanism.
Expansion logic will be added in later tickets.
