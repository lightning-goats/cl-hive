"""
Cooperative Expansion Module for cl-hive (Phase 6.4)

Coordinates channel opening decisions across hive members to optimize
topology without redundant connections or conflicts.

When a peer becomes available (e.g., after a remote close), this module:
1. Evaluates if the peer is worth opening a channel to
2. Starts a nomination round where interested members self-nominate
3. Elects the best candidate based on liquidity, diversity, and load balancing
4. Broadcasts the election result so only one member opens

Election Criteria:
- Must not already have a channel to the target
- Must have sufficient liquidity (> min channel size)
- Preference for members with fewer total channels (load balancing)
- Preference for members who haven't recently opened channels (fairness)
- Quality score tiebreaker
