"""
Splice Coordinator Module

Coordinates timing of splice operations to maintain fleet connectivity.
SAFETY CHECKS ONLY - no fund movement between nodes.

Each node manages its own splices independently, but checks with
the fleet before splice-out to avoid creating connectivity gaps.

How this helps without fund transfer:
- Prevents a node from splicing out if it would break fleet connectivity
- Coordinates timing so another member can open capacity first
- Advisory only - nodes can proceed with their own decision
