"""
Settlement module for cl-hive

Implements BOLT12-based revenue settlement for hive fleet members.

Fair Share Algorithm:
- 40% weight: Capacity contribution (total_capacity / fleet_capacity)
- 40% weight: Routing contribution (forwards_routed / fleet_forwards)
- 20% weight: Uptime contribution (uptime_pct / 100)

Settlement Flow:
1. Each member registers a BOLT12 offer for receiving payments
2. At settlement time, collect fees_earned from each member
3. Calculate fair_share for each member
4. Generate payment list (surplus members pay deficit members)
5. Execute payments via BOLT12

Thread Safety:
- Uses thread-local database connections via HiveDatabase pattern
