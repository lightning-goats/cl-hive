"""
Phase 3: Cost Reduction Module for Yield Optimization.

This module reduces rebalancing costs by up to 50% through:

1. Predictive Rebalancing: Rebalance BEFORE depletion when urgency is low
2. Fleet Rebalance Routing: Use fleet members as cheaper rebalance hops
3. Circular Flow Detection: Identify and prevent wasteful circular flows

The goal is to move liquidity proactively when fees are low rather than
reactively when desperate and fees are high.
