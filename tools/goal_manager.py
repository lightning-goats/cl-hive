Goal Manager for Proactive AI Advisor

Manages measurable goals for node optimization and tracks progress.
Goals are set based on node analysis and strategy, with progress
checked each cycle and strategy adjusted if off-track.

Usage:
    from goal_manager import GoalManager, Goal

    manager = GoalManager(db)
    goals = manager.analyze_and_set_goals(node_state)
    progress = manager.check_progress(goal, current_value)
