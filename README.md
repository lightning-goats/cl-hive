# cl-hive

**The Coordination Layer for Core Lightning Fleets.**

## Overview

`cl-hive` is a Core Lightning plugin that enables "Swarm Intelligence" across independent nodes. It transforms a group of disparate Lightning nodes into a coordinated fleet that shares state, optimizes topology, and manages liquidity collectively.

## Architecture

```
cl-hive (Coordination Layer - "The Diplomat")
    ↓
cl-revenue-ops (Execution Layer - "The CFO")
    ↓
Core Lightning
```

`cl-hive` acts as the **"Diplomat"** or **"Chief Strategy Officer"** that communicates with other nodes in the fleet. It works alongside [cl-revenue-ops](https://github.com/LightningGoats/cl-revenue-ops), which acts as the **"CFO"** managing local channel profitability and fee policies.

## Core Features

### Secure PKI Handshake
Cryptographic authentication using Core Lightning's HSM-bound keys. No external crypto libraries required.

### Shared State (HiveMap)
Efficient gossip protocol with anti-entropy (state hashing) ensures all members have a consistent view of fleet capacity and topology.

### Intent Lock Protocol
Deterministic conflict resolution prevents "thundering herd" issues when multiple nodes attempt the same coordinated action.

### Topology Planner (The Gardner)
Automated algorithm that detects saturated targets and proposes expansions to underserved high-value peers. Includes feerate gate to prevent expensive channel opens during high-fee periods.

### Hierarchical Membership
Supports `admin`, `member`, and `neophyte` tiers with algorithmic promotion based on uptime and contribution.

### Cooperative Fee Coordination
Fleet-wide fee intelligence sharing and aggregation for coordinated fee strategies.

### No Node Left Behind (NNLB)
Health monitoring and liquidity needs detection across the fleet.

### VPN Transport Support
Optional WireGuard VPN integration for secure fleet communication.

## Governance Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `advisor` | Log recommendations and queue actions for manual approval (default) |
| `autonomous` | Execute actions automatically within strict safety bounds |
| `oracle` | Delegate decisions to external API |

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Core Lightning (CLN) v23.05+
- Python 3.8+
- `cl-revenue-ops` v1.4.0+ (Recommended for full functionality)

### Optional Integrations
- **CLBoss**: Not required. If installed, cl-hive coordinates to prevent redundant channel opens.
- **Sling**: Not required for cl-hive. Rebalancing is handled by cl-revenue-ops.

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/santyr/cl-hive.git
cd cl-hive

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start CLN with the plugin
lightningd --plugin=/path/to/cl-hive/cl-hive.py
```
