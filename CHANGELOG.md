  - Members auto-vote when data hash matches (quorum: 51%)
  - Each node pays their share via BOLT12 offers
  - Period-based idempotency prevents double settlement

- **Uptime Tracking**: Automatic uptime percentage calculation from peer presence data
- **Docker Update Documentation**: Step-by-step guide for updating Docker deployments

### Fixed
- **ISO Week Parsing**: Fixed week boundary calculations using `fromisocalendar()`
- **Settlement Fee Discovery**: Now checks database fee_reports before in-memory state
- **Pool Snapshot RPC**: Fixed handling of `List[MemberContribution]` return type
- **Uptime in Fair Share**: Fixed 0% uptime by syncing from peer_presence to hive_members
- **Backfill Column Names**: Fixed `hive-backfill-fees` to use correct schema columns
- **Period Parameter**: `hive-fee-reports period=latest` now recognized as special case

### Changed
- **Settlement Weights**: 30% capacity, 60% routing volume, 10% uptime (updated from 40/40/20)
- Uptime synced on startup and hourly via maintenance loop
