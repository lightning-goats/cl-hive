## AUTO-PROCESS CHANNEL OPENS
For each pending channel_open action on each node, automatically approve or reject based on these criteria:

APPROVE only if ALL conditions met:
- Target node has >15 active channels (strong connectivity)
- Target median fee is <500 ppm (quality routing partner)
- Current on-chain fees are <20 sat/vB
- Channel size is 2-10M sats
- Node has <30 total channels AND <40% underwater channels
- Opening maintains 500k sats on-chain reserve
- Not a duplicate channel to existing peer

REJECT if ANY condition applies:
- Target has <10 channels (insufficient connectivity)
- On-chain fees >30 sat/vB (wait for lower fees)
- Node already has >30 channels (focus on profitability)
- Node has >40% underwater channels (fix existing first)
- Amount below 1M sats or above 10M sats
- Would create duplicate channel
- Insufficient on-chain balance for reserve

Use hive_approve_action or hive_reject_action for each pending channel_open.

## REPORT SECTIONS
After processing actions, provide a report with these sections:

### FLEET HEALTH (use advisor_get_trends and hive_status)
- Total nodes and their status (online/offline)
- Fleet-wide capacity and revenue trends (7-day)
- Hive membership summary (members/neophytes)
- Any internal competition or coordination issues

### PER-NODE SUMMARIES (for each node)
1) Node state (capacity, channels, ROC%, underwater%)
2) Goals progress and strategy adjustments needed
3) Opportunities found by type and actions taken/queued
4) Next cycle priorities

### ACTIONS TAKEN
- List channel opens approved with reasoning
- List channel opens rejected with reasoning'
